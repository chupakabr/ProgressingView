## Installation

ProgressingView is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'ProgressingView'
```

Alternatively you can embed the library straight into your project by copying the ProgressingView.swift file.

## Usage

Drop a View onto your storyboard, change the class to ProgressingView and start configuring your ProgressingView.

Note: You can safely use the ProgressingView as a container for other views. It also means that if you want to change your current root View with a full screen background progressing view then it's possible by changing the class to ProgressingView as usual.
